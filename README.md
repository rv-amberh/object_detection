# Tesla Frontend UI/UX challenge

## Solution:

Install dependencies  (`node_modules`):

```
npm install
```

And run with

```
npm run start
```

All of the `test_images` and `train_images` have been combined into one single folder under `public/images/`.

## Prompt

- Challenge:

  Build a user interface for displaying and searching an image dataset for training
  a neural net model for self-driving cars.

  We are providing you with the image dataset. The images are in the "images" folders
  and the labels are in the "labels.csv" file. The top, left, width, and height colums represent a bounding box highlighting a visual within the image. 

- Required features:

  - Display images
  - Draw bounding box highlighting visual within on each image
  - Filter by label tag, disabled by default
  - Display label information

- Deliverables:

  An archive including the source code required to run the application.
  External dependencies should NOT be included, but should be obtainable with a single command (yarn, npm install, etc.).
  After obtaining dependencies, the user should be able to run and view the interface with a single, clearly documented command.

  Your archive should be named as <your initials>-frontend-challenge.<file type>, for example:
  abc-frontend-challenge.zip

- Notes:

  The app should take no more than three hours to complete, and should minimize the number of external runtime dependencies. If you manage to deliver all required features in a reasonable period, stand out of the crowd with features or UX polish of your choosing.
